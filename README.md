# Tap Jacking

Tap Jacking is a technique where a malicious app tricks the user into clicking a security-relevant control (confirmation button etc.) by obscuring the UI with an overlay or by other means.

Additional details of this vulnerability can be found in the [Android Developer Documentation](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/tapjacking).

Whilst Android devices running Android 12 and higher prevent this by default, your Capacitor app may be running on older versions.
